The most important information needed for underwater navigation is how deep you are and what direction you're pointing. ROVs, AUVs, and even more passive marine systems need this information, so we've created a Depth/ IMU module for this purpose. The design is focused on robustness. It uses a Keller 7LD depth sensor which can be submerged for long periods of time, and a BNO 085 Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU) that has a 3-axis magnatometer, a 3-axis gyrometer, and a 3-axis magnitometer. The system uses the Bristlemouth underwater connectivity standard to communicate and get power, and the PCB has been designed to mate with a Bristlemouth Mote made by Sofar Ocean Technologies. The board is designed in KiCAD 8.0.4.
